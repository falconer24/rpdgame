			opponent's algorithm.

3. rpd_algo1.c:		First algorithm that we devised. Makes use of
			probability of the opponent's moves.

4. rpd_algo2.c:		Improvement over the first algorithm. Combines the
			probabilistic method of the first algorithm with the 
			tit-for-tat strategy

5. rpd.h:		Header file for the globals and structures used in the
			code.

6. trials.sh:		Shell script which runs 500 games, with 50 rounds each,
			each with different inputs to the random number
			generator used in the opponent.

			To run the first algorithm, run this with argument 1 and 
			to run the second one, with argument 2 
			
			./trials.sh 1 OR ./trials.sh 2

7. Makefile:		Makefile for this program
			
			Different options to the makefile --
